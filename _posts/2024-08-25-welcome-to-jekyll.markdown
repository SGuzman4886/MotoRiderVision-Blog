Welcome to the MotoRiderVision-Blog! This is where we'll be sharing our journey as I develop an innovative AR helmet app for motorcycle riders. Stay tuned for updates and insights into the future of motorcycle safety and technology.

My project aims to create a helmet mounted app that integrates Augmented Reality (AR) for GPS navigation, speed monitoring, and rear view capabilities for enhancing both safety and convenience for riders. 

Stay tuned for more updates as we bring this cutting-edge technology to life!
